2f) In two or three sentences, describe what is wrong with this strict percentage increase
model of zombie growth in the limits of a large and a small number of zombies. This
problem is mathematically equivalent to several chemical engineering problems; for
example, the amount of a compound formed in an autocatalytic reaction as a function of
time, or the growth of bacteria or yeast in a fermenter. But zombies are more fun. Grrarll

In real life situations the growth rate is not constant for the entirety of the duration. 
Factors such as limited space/resources/materials and in this case, carrying capacity (food + space?) 
would decrease the growth rate over time.

3c) Note that I did not specify the value of xcurr that you start with. What are the requirements
for the starting value so that we eventually converge to the square root? What strategy did
you use to figure this out? Write the answers in the .pdf file HW1_textsolution.

It seems like any positive value would work (excluding 0). If a negative value is used then the function would compute the 
right value but negative. For example, if a = 4 and the guesss was -2, the function would output -4. Also, if a 0 was used as a guess,
the function would take a long time to execute. For my computer it was not able to execute the function.
